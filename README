shncpd -- the simple, stupid and slow HNCP daemon
=================================================

shncpd is an implementation of the Home Networking Control Protocol.

Compile with "make", or with "make EXTRA_DEFINES=-DUSE_LIBUBOX".

To join a Homenet, just pass the list of interfaces on the command line:

    shncpd eth0 wlan0

Add "-d2" to see what is going on.
