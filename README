shncpd -- the simple, stupid and slow HNCP daemon
=================================================

shncpd is an implementation of the Home Networking Control Protocol (HNCP)
and associated protocols.  It currently implements:

  * DNCP flooding;
  * prefix and address assignment;
  * prefix delegation (manually configured);
  * router advertisement server;
  * DHCPv4 server.

It does not implement routing itself, but relies on babeld.


Compiling
---------

Compile with one of the following:

    make

or

    make EXTRA_DEFINES=-DUSE_LIBUBOX LDLIBS=-lubox

or

    make EXTRA_DEFINES=-DUSE_OPENSSL LDLIBS=-lcrypto


Running
-------

First, run babeld and tell it to redistribute protocol 43:

    babeld -C 'redistribute local deny' \
           -C 'redistribute proto 43 allow' \
           eth0 wlan0

Then, run shncpd, passing the list of (internal) Homenet interfaces on the
command line:

    shncpd eth0 wlan0

In order to announce delegated prefixes and name servers, use the -E
and -N flags:

    shncpd -E 2001:db8:42::/48 -N 2001:db8:42::53 \
           -E 10.0.0.0/8 \
           eth0 wlan0

There is a manual page -- if everything else fails, read the documentation.
